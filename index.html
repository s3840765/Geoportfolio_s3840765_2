		This website contains the Geoportfolio of George McNamara and was made for the Professional Practice (2350) unit at RMIT University. 
		It has been made for professional and academic purposes.
		<p>
		Just to quickly learn a bit more about me, I was born originally in Essex, England and moved to Melbourne, Australia when I was ten and so I have spent most of my life here.
		I am currently in my third year of the Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying) (Honours) course which I transfered to after partly completing the
		Bachelor of Science (Geospatial Science) (Honours) course also at RMIT. I am still learning more about what specific parth of surveying I wish to go down but 
		I am specifically intrigued by the use of unmanned aerial systems and how we can survey from the air using aerial imagery and Lidar sensors. 
		</p>
		<p>
		In my spare time I enjoying playing sport mainly Soccer and have just started getting in running and joining in Parkrun on saturdays. I hope this website tells you
		more about me and my journey in surveying!

	<div class="academic-intro">
		Land Surveying can be conducted in a variety of forms, whether this is through a property boundary or cadastral sense, or in an engieneering sense.
		One unit conducted in third year land surveying is Cadastral Surveying Practise which introduces students to the basics of cadastral land surveying
		in a property sense, specialising in property boundaries, re-establishment surveys and an introduction to using CAD software to draft subdivision surveys.
		Below are two submitted examples from this assesment which looked at different aspects of cadastral surveying.
		<ul>
			<li>Assesment 2a: Parkville Practical Survey - This was a worksheet drawn up after conducting a survey in Parkville and compupations conducted
				to display the relationship between the occupation and the title.</li>
			<li>Assesment 3: Plan of Subdivision - This assignment utilized existing subdiviosn plans to be drawn on AutoCad software and submitted as a PDF along
				along with a facesheet
		</ul>
		<p>
			Below are items listed above that I have created as part of my course:

	<div class="academic-intro">
		Before transfering to Land Surveying, I was a Geospatial Science student and one of the unit a part of that course what SIS Analytics which
		delved deeper into how maps can display quantitative data whether through a digital terraim model or a thematic map.

		For the semester project we had to pose ourself a question or an aim and I decided upon creating a maps that displayed how long it took by bus for students 
		to get to their high school by bus. The scale chosen was just for a city council region, with Whitehorse the chosen area.

		For this project the main devilerable was a heatmap that displayed the process of how long it took student in certain mesh blocks, the smallest possible area, to get from house to school and this was done in three steps:
		<ol>
			<li>Distance and time walking from the house to closest bus stop</li>
			<li>Distance and time by bus from the bus stop closest to the house to the bus stop closest to the school</li>
			<li>Distance and time walking from the bus stop closest to the school to the school itself</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			The data was mostly obtained from Data Victoria and all the processing was conducted using the Network Analysis tool in the mapping software Arcmap.
			There was extensive data manipulation before the final map was produced as will displayed in the flow chart below. Also below is the final maps what was made.

		This page will briefly cover my work experience (as of OCtober 2023) within land surveying. I have currently only worked for one company being Thinkspatial. This section will describe

	<div class="job-overview">
		My wok at Thinkspatial has been a good introduction to the Surveying industry as a whole giving me oppourtunities to further my knowledge and experiance in surveying.
		My roles have been a mixture of both office based work as well as field work in the form of visiting various worksites run by various organisations. Thinkspatial is an
		engieneering specialising surveying company and so all sites visited and worked on have been constructions sites presenting their own challenges. I have learnt the basic 
		skills of survey setouts, leveling, traversing and picking up as-built items with both total station and GNSS receiver technologies.
		<p>
		The office components have mostly consisted of CAD developments and editing as well as helping withh development for Thinkspatial subcompany Civillo. Working here 
		has given me knowledge that I wouldn't have aquired at university and it continues to enable me to learn and challenge myself as a surveyor.
